# skratchLooper
This is a tool that plays audio loops for scratch performances.   
Loopers like this have mainly been created in Flash and can be seen on sites like www.scratchloopers.com.   Since Flash is being phased out by modern web browsers and this is my take on recreating this experience in html5.   
I am using HowlerJS to manipulate the audio files.   
All loops and images are from Ritchie Ruftone's Free 2018 Looper and can be found here https://djritchieruftone.bandcamp.com/album/ritchie-ruftone-2018-looper-beats-free-download
